here is where I put inverse modeling notes


Forward Model:
Am=d - Linear easier to solve where things scale linearly



non linear d=A(m)- certain values do not scale with the other parameters.


slip= output scales with the input.


[1 2][x]   = [4]
[2 -1][y]    [1]




x + 2y = 4
x - y= 1




column rep

x [1]	[2]   = [4]
  [1] +y [-1]	[1]


square matrix--
x and b equal in size

a well posed problem, not typical.




Dense linear algebra

Not equal shapes for x and b for matrix

differnece of pred b and obs b is the well fit of the model


as long as the range of a is = m. if A < M then its "rank deficient"?


weird E ' a member of '


What if A is rectangular?
Well, then unless b weird E range(A), A x = b has no exact
solution

least squares solution to an inverse problem ax=b is a vetor x such that ||ax-b|| = minimal

(ax) forward model - (b) data


minimum is when ax-b is orhtogenal to the range of A

see powerpoint...



solution of thoughts

a-Ax perpen. range (A)

<-> b-Ax perp asubj
<-> asubj.... see powerpoint slide 


this will give you the problem well posed- or square matrix

AsupertAx = Asupe(t) * b
